The banishment from quests continued to gnaw at them. Boredom became their relentless companion, and they sought refuge in exploration. One day, driven by a desire to uncover secrets, they decided to visit the castle's library. The dimly lit room held countless books, but as a child, \(mainCharacter.name) had noticed that some of them were missing pages. They had never forgotten that peculiar detail, and now, that curiosity propelled them. As they stepped into the library, their eyes fell upon the rows of books, but the sight that met them was disheartening. Every book in the library had been vandalized, pages torn out, and knowledge erased. A memory resurfaced, the remnants of a burned building they had explored after confiding in their \(mainCharacter.pStatusTitle()). A disturbing thought took hold the \(mainCharacter.parentalStatus()) had something to hide. Their rage burned white-hot, and they no longer cared about the ban on leaving the castle. Instead, they decided to release their anger by battling monsters in the forest, choosing the full moon night for their venturous hunt. Hours passed as they slew monster after monster, the frigid air revealing their every breath. But just when exhaustion was about to overcome them, a heart-rending scream pierced the silence. \(mainCharacter.name)'s shock and determination to help led them toward the source. Through snow and trees, blinded by the night, they arrived at the scene of a young boy, flames dancing in his hands as he valiantly defended himself against a horde of monsters. \(mainCharacter.name), always ready to help, hesitated this time due to the boy's use of magic.")

The boy's eyes widened in shock at this sudden intervention, but his expression soon twisted into rage upon recognizing \(mainCharacter.name). As \(mainCharacter.name) engaged the other monsters, a torrent of flames surged towards them. They dodged the fiery onslaught, but the hood covering their head was singed. Confusion and anger filled their voice as they asked the boy why he was raging when there were monsters all around. The boy's response hit like a bolt of lightning. He accused the kingdom and its people of being the real monsters, hunting down magic users for their own greed. \(mainCharacter.name) was left reeling by this revelation, and it didn't take long before the monsters and the boy turned on them. Desperate, \(mainCharacter.name) managed to escape and returned to the castle as the sun began to rise, their perspective forever altered. Back at the castle, \(mainCharacter.name) couldn't contain their desire to confront the \(mainCharacter.parentalStatus()) about the missing pages and their newfound experience with magic.")

It was clear the boy had control over them, making their movements predictable. The boy, fueled by a cruel satisfaction, taunted \(mainCharacter.name), asking how it felt to be helpless. Anger welled up within \(mainCharacter.name), and they lashed out, slaying the monsters, but one escaped. Fear overtook the boy, and he clambered onto the remaining creature's back, fleeing the scene.

In the cruel theatre of fate, their hand became a marionette's stringed appendage, manipulated by the nefarious maestro of fury. With a malevolent dance, the blade was unleashed, a scythe of retribution. In an ethereal instant, it tore through the veil of the \(mainCharacter.parentalStatus())'s existence, severing the monarch's reign and silencing their imperious voice. The kingdom, thrust into the abyss of chaos, became an aimless ship adrift on the tumultuous sea of fate. \(mainCharacter.name)'s impulsive act had painted the canvas of destiny with a stroke of unrelenting darkness, leaving an indelible mark upon the annals of the kingdom's history.")

Violence, they realized, was a door to nowhere. In that profound moment, \(mainCharacter.name) chose to shatter the vicious cycle that had ensnared them. Instead of rebelling against the \(mainCharacter.parentalStatus())'s criticism as they had so often done, they chose a different path. The embers of their determination flickered anew, as they vowed to illuminate their worthiness through nobler means. The pledge they made was not only to the kingdom but to themselvesâ€”a testament to their resilience and their commitment to change the course of their story.")

They engaged in a fierce battle that raged on for some time until the hooded figure launched \(mainCharacter.name) into a wall, walking away towards their sinister objective.

Despite the celebration, they made the difficult decision to vanish from the kingdom, embarking on a solitary journey to find their own path. As the first rays of dawn broke through the horizon, a sense of quiet settled around the campfire. The young boy, his curiosity piqued, couldn't help but wonder aloud, \"That's it? There's no more about the prince/princess \(mainCharacter.name)?\" The mysterious person, cloaked in the warmth of the fire's glow, sighed softly. \"After that, no one knows about or the location of \(mainCharacter.name),\" they replied cryptically, their focus on extinguishing the remaining embers. \"Darn, wish I could meet them,\" the kid lamented, a twinge of disappointment in his voice. The mysterious figure rose slowly, the morning light revealing their tired and weathered appearance, which bore an uncanny resemblance to the description of \(mainCharacter.name). The kid's eyes widened in surprise. The boy began to ask, \"Are you...?\" before the mystery person gently cut him off, saying, \"Thanks for the meal, kid. You should head home soon; your parents must be worried sick.\" \"Sure thing,\" the kid responded, lowering his head momentarily before looking up again at the enigmatic figure. He couldn't resist the urge to inquire further. \"So, where are you going to go? Can you teach me how to use a sword?\" He held onto a glimmer of hope that this person could teach him to be as strong as they seemed. The mystery person hesitated for a moment, then admitted they were on a mission to atone for past mistakes. With that revelation, the boy watched in silence as the mysterious figure began to walk away into the distance, leaving behind the warmth of the fire and a sense of intrigue.")
    let badEnding: Text = Text("The villagers were furious and demanded answers from the King, accusing \(mainCharacter.name) of being unworthy of their leadership. The King, his eyes filled with anger and remorse, acknowledged their previous blindness to the dangers posed by magic users. With newfound determination, the King pledged to make amends by eradicating all forms of magic from the land. The crackling of the fire grew more intense as a piece of wood was thrown into it, causing the flames to leap higher and more erratically. The young boy, not entirely satisfied with the story he had heard, inquired, \"That's it? There's no more about the prince/princess \(mainCharacter.name)?\" The enigmatic figure continued to feed the fire, adding more wood to it, casting eerie flickering shadows across their face. \"After that, no one knows about or the location of \(mainCharacter.name),\" they muttered quietly, their intentions unclear. \"They sound like they're up to no good,\" the kid murmured, a sense of unease creeping over him. The mysterious person abruptly rose, blocking the light from the fire, preventing the kid from getting a clear look at their face. The young boy started to ask, \"So, do you have any more stories...\" before he was interrupted by the mystery person. \"Thanks for the meal, kid. Perhaps you can point me in the direction of your village?\" they said, their voice tinged with an unsettling tone, as they began packing up their belongings. \"Sure thing, it's to the north that way,\" the boy replied, pointing toward his village. His curiosity unabated, he tried once more. \"So, can you teach me how to use a sword...?\" The mystery person, growing more distant and aloof, replied that they were on a mission and couldn't be bothered at the moment. The dejected boy watched as the mysterious figure walked away into the shadows. As the boy gathered more firewood, he heard distant sounds of people running in the direction of his village, suddenly stopping in his tracks. Intrigued, he left the fire and headed back in that direction. As he raised his head, he heard the chilling sounds of screaming, now unmistakably coming from his village. In utter shock, he dropped the firewood and ran towards the village, views of smoke billowing from the rooftops as he approached his village. Friends and family becoming the sources of the horrifying screams. In the distance, he spotted the enigmatic figure that told him the story and shared a meal with him, standing in the midst of the chaos, the sole cause of his village's destruction")
